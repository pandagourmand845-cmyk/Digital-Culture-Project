    <section>
        <p>The digitization of dating through Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, and Happn promises one thing that all these tools have in common: faster and more efficient encounters. However, behind the romanticism, bright colors, and motivating/reassuring messages in notifications lies another facet: that of the market. A like is a transaction, a profile is a consumable product, and every emotion experienced by the user is a lever for profit. This raises the question: is it still love, or is it just shopping?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>I chose to focus on the commodification aspect of "digital love." When I look at dating apps, they seem free, but through our project I realized that they operate on a freemium model: basic features are accessible but limited, causing frustration if you don't pay. For example: Tinder Plus, Gold, and Platinum allow for greater visibility, the ability to see who has "liked" you, or to appear at the top of other users' feeds.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Freemium Market</h2>
        <p>In 2024, Tinder generated $1.99 billion, Bumble $1.07 billion, and Hinge $550 million in revenue. When I started working on the digitization of dating, apps immediately brought to mind the famous phrase:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            "If you're not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the product being sold"
            <span class="quote-author">— Tim O'Reilly</span>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>which makes perfect sense here. The product is my desire, which is exploited and monetized. Even the simple act of swiping could be likened to shopping: it may symbolize immediate attraction or rejection, but more broadly it is an act of purchase or refusal. This implies a certain monotony and brutality in the selection process. It reminds me directly of Barry Schwartz's "paradox of choice":</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            "an abundance of options does not make us happier, but creates anxiety and dissatisfaction."
            <span class="quote-author">— Barry Schwartz</span>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>The consumerist model of these apps transforms intimacy into fast consumption, and the fear of missing out on the "right choice" is accentuated by the limitations of the freemium model.</p>
        
        <h3>Negative Consequences</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The illusion of choice:</strong> we have the impression that the choice is infinite and depends solely on our personal criteria, whereas the algorithm selects the visible profiles, which illustrates a lack of transparency and accentuates inequalities. Furthermore, this hinders the creation of lasting relationships because they seem more easily replaceable (Zygmunt Bauman, Liquid Love, 2003).</li>
            
            <li><strong>Rationalized love:</strong> users adopt a clear strategy, filtering and optimizing their chances to meet specific codes specific to these applications. Love loses its spontaneity.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Widespread frustration:</strong> the majority of users experience significant emotional fatigue, feeling like just another product among many, which can lead to a loss of confidence and homogenization of individuals (by adapting to implicit codes, users place less value on their originality and authenticity).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The reward system and gamification, as discussed in the group project, counterbalance this frustration by providing dopamine. This is what creates a certain addiction to these tools, with the ultimate solution for promoting the release of dopamine being the credit card.</p>
        <p>The lack of prevention messages or solutions to these problems directly from the apps reveals ethical shortcomings and the exploitation of individuals' loneliness for commercial purposes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Data Collection Challenges</h2>
        <p>The issue of data collection raises several concerns. Apps not only hold personal information (address, name, age), but also much more intimate data: our tastes, the type of relationships we are looking for, our sexual orientation, and even specific criteria.</p>
        <p>This fear is heightened by the lack of transparency surrounding the resale of data from one app to another (the terms and conditions of use are rarely read because they are not very intuitive). With algorithmic power, data collection, and targeted advertising already extremely prevalent on social media, this raises questions about the potential impact of such databases built on individuals' deepest desires.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>What Are the Solutions?</h2>
        <p>We could imagine several solutions to limit the risks of these applications in order to best protect individuals psychologically, behaviorally, and financially.</p>
        
        <h3>Psychological and behavioral:</h3>
        <p>Integrate prevention messages into applications (as is done for alcohol or tobacco), with regular notifications about the risks of addiction, emotional fatigue, or disillusionment. We could also add features to manage usage time, as on Instagram or YouTube.</p>
        
        <h3>Financial and ethical:</h3>
        <p>Limit freemium abuse. Regulate the use of personal data with a requirement for clarity on its use and resale (for example, through a simplified and understandable format, or with the integration of an AI chatbot to respond to user concerns). Regulate certain paid features that exacerbate inequalities, as well as gamification and its dopamine-based reward system mechanisms.</p>
        
        <h3>Social alternatives:</h3>
        <p>Encourage alternative models, such as platforms without advertising or data resale (financed by transparent and fair subscriptions), or non-profit community models. Above all, develop genuine digital education in high schools and universities to raise awareness of the risks of these new tools and enable users to better control their experience.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="personal">
        <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
        <p>I was struck by the similarity between shopping platforms and dating apps, which share many features and codes in common. This raises questions about their use and the changes in our attitudes toward intimacy and social relationships. If I had to expand on this topic, I would say that these issues do not only affect the digitization of dating, but more broadly, digital culture. Our time, interests, emotions, and relationships are monetized and analyzed. Our relationship with these technologies is a two-way street in which they adapt to each of us and we adapt our behavior as well. This makes me think about how I use these tools in the way I consume and maintain my social relationships.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="critique">
        <h2>AI and Digital Culture: A Critical Perspective</h2>
        <p>The discussion with <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68dc274c-d524-8013-bbde-ea7606b66cb3" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a> around the subject of dating apps and the commodification of desire revealed several biases in these responses.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Criticism of the ChatGPT discussion:</strong><br>
        It tends to reinforce social and gender stereotypes. When discussing dating apps, it generalizes behaviors by gender (men more direct, women more selective) and by app (Tinder superficial, Hinge serious). This likely reflects its training data and dominant cultural discourses on dating.</p>
        
        <p>ChatGPT also oversimplifies complex social phenomena. It often provides ratings or evaluations on apps and user behaviors, without exception. This oversimplification can mislead users and reinforce stereotypes about the Gen Z dating model.</p>
        
        <p>Furthermore, it reproduces the platforms' algorithmic biases. Its responses sometimes highlight certain profiles or app features as the best or most attractive. Combined with clear wording, this approach can favor certain apps over others in users' choices.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, ChatGPT tends to initially provide unreliable and non-academic sources, especially on a subject like this (a very popular topic). For example, it will provide me with blog sites on how to create the perfect Tinder profile, instead of serious studies on the subject.</p>
